# CS194 - Computational Photography and Computer Vision

This is the, now public, repo to CS194 at UC Berkeley. This was one of my absolute favorite classes I've taken and it made for quite nice visuals.

### Projects

1. [Modernizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/sp20/upload/files/proj1/cs194-26-aev/)
2. [Fun with Filters and Frequencies](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/sp20/upload/files/proj2/cs194-26-aev/)
3. [Face Morphing](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/sp20/upload/files/proj3/cs194-26-aev/) Note: This was done during midterm searson which is why I look like absolute hell.
4. [Deep Learning](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/sp20/upload/files/proj4/cs194-26-aev/)
5. Not listed for some reason.
