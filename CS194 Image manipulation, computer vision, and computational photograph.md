#### A brief history of the visual data

First synthetic representaion of the world about 14000 years ago. More symbolic than realistic. Renaissance is the first time when there is a major concentration on realism, added some prespective and depth and stuff. Photography came along and was obviously a major imporvment even over very skilled painters but still not actually reality. We now value some less realistic stuff like impressionism because it has a similar ability to convey meaning. 20th century art is all about diffrent representations.
